# F1 Clash Manager Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring the F1 Clash Manager application into a modular structure.

## Current Progress

✅ Created basic directory structure  
✅ Extracted data loading and saving functions to `modules/data_manager.py`  
✅ Extracted utility functions to `modules/utils.py`  
✅ Extracted loadout management to `modules/loadouts.py`  
✅ Created a new main application file `app.py`  
✅ Extracted driver management to `modules/drivers.py`  
✅ Extracted component management to `modules/components.py`  
✅ Extracted track and series setup management to `modules/tracks.py`  
✅ Extracted import tools to `modules/import_tools.py`  
✅ Created UI components in `ui/common.py`  
✅ Standardized data types and error handling  
✅ Updated main application file  
✅ Added documentation (README.md and requirements.txt)  
✅ Added Series Loadouts feature  

## Completed Refactoring

The refactoring of the F1 Clash Manager application is now complete. The application has been restructured into a modular architecture with the following components:

### Modules
- `modules/data_manager.py`: Data loading and saving functions
- `modules/utils.py`: Utility functions for data processing
- `modules/loadouts.py`: Loadout management functionality
- `modules/drivers.py`: Driver management functionality
- `modules/components.py`: Component management functionality
- `modules/tracks.py`: Track and series setup management functionality
- `modules/import_tools.py`: CSV import functionality
- `modules/series_data.py`: Series-based loadout recommendations

### UI Components
- `ui/common.py`: Common UI components for consistent display

### Main Application
- `app.py`: Main application file with navigation and page routing

### Data Files
- `loadouts.json`: Store user-created loadouts
- `rotating_series.json`: Store current track stats for rotating series
- `series_data.json`: Store series information with track stats

### Documentation
- `README.md`: Application documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies
- `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`: This document

## Key Improvements

1. **Modular Architecture**: Code is now organized into logical modules
2. **Consistent Error Handling**: All modules use consistent error handling patterns
3. **Type Standardization**: Data types are standardized across the application
4. **Improved UI Components**: Common UI patterns are extracted into reusable functions
5. **Better Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation
6. **Enhanced Navigation**: Improved navigation and page routing
7. **Series-Based Organization**: Loadouts can now be organized and recommended by series

## Latest Feature: Series Loadouts

The new Series Loadouts feature enhances the application with the following capabilities:

1. **Loadouts By Series**: View and organize loadouts by game series (Grand Prix, Series 8, Series 9, Series 10+)
2. **Series-Specific Recommendations**: Get loadout recommendations based on the dominant stat for each series
3. **Rotating Series Management**: Set the current dominant stat for rotating series (10, 11, 12)
4. **Intelligent Loadout Matching**: Find the best loadouts for each series based on track stats
5. **Series Data Import**: Import series information from the F1 Clash Resource Sheet CSV
6. **Series Match Tab**: A new tab in the Loadouts Manager to match loadouts to their best series

## Future Improvements

While the refactoring is complete, here are some potential future improvements:

1. Add unit tests for each module
2. Implement user authentication
3. Add data backup and restore functionality
4. Create a settings page for application configuration
5. Add data visualization for performance analysis
6. Implement a dark mode theme option
7. Add more detailed series information including tracks in each series
8. Create a race simulation feature to test loadouts against specific tracks
